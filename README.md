# Lord of the Rings Website

This project was created for **CIDM 6303 – Technical Foundations of CIS** (Fall 2025) as **Project 1: Build a Website**.  
The goal of this assignment was to design a multi-page website using **HTML, CSS, and best practices** for web structure and styling.


## Project Overview
- **Topic:** The history and lore of Tolkien's *Lord of the Rings* universe.  
- **Pages:**
  - `index.html` → Homepage introducing the theme.  
  - `deep-cuts.html` → Explores deep lore such as the fall of Númenor.  
  - `rings-of-power.html` → Focuses on the forging of the Rings of Power.  
- **Styling:**  
  - `styles.css` handles all visual design (colors, layout, fonts).  
  - Pages use consistent navigation, headings, and formatting.


##  Images
All images are stored in the `/images` folder:  
- `elves.jpg` – Awakening of the Elves  
- `numenor.jpg` – Downfall of Númenor  
- `rings.jpg` – Forging the Rings of Power  

Sources: Public domain/educational fair use for course purposes.


## Features
- External CSS stylesheet applied to all pages.  
- Semantic HTML structure with `<main>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`.  
- Navigation links included on every page for easy browsing.  
- Form included on `rings-of-power.html` to demonstrate interactivity.  
- Fully structured to meet the course rubric:
  - 3+ substantial paragraphs on each page.
  - At least one `<ol>` / `<ul>` and `<hr>` included.
  - Proper use of `<html>`, `<body>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<a>`, `<img>`.



## 🚀 How to View
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser **OR** use VS Code with the Live Server extension.  
3. Navigate the site using the menu links.



## 📌 Notes
- This repository is also part of my coursework submission for CIDM 6303.  
- Built with human-style coding: clean, readable, and consistent, without auto-generated code.  
- Structure matches professional web development best practices (images in subfolder, external CSS, semantic HTML).
